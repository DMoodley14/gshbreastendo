# GROOTE SCHUUR HOSPITAL BREAST & ENDOCRINE SURGERY REFERRAL APP

An online medical referral tool:
Developed using Flutter and Firebase. Purposed for Groote Schuur Hospital's(GSH) Breast and Endocrine Surgery Department

Problem: Patients with suspected Breast or Endocrine Cancers need to be evaluated urgently by specialist surgeons. Doctors from peripheral regions refer patients to tertiary centres usually by telephone. The GSH Surgical Team used email and JotForms available through their website as adjuncts to the gold-standard telephonic referrals. However, doctors and nurses preferred using the telephone.

Solution: A mobile app embedding the existing jotform to make using web services more user-friendly thereby increasing uptake.
Planned as a cross-platform solution targeting both Apple and Android users. 

Status: Published on Google Playstore with approx 100 users.
